What is the cloud?
************************************************************************************

cloud computing
---------------
 is a technological approach where computing resources are provisioned in a shareable way so that lots of users get what they need when they need it.

 At the heart of cloud computing is a technology known as hardware virtualization.

 Hardware Virtualization"
 ------------------------
 Hardware virtualization is a core concept of how cloud computing technologies work. It allows the concept of a physical machine and a logical machine to be abstracted away from each other.
 
  With virtualization, a single physical machine called a host could run many individual virtual instances called guests

Hypervisor"
-----------
A hypervisor is a piece of software that runs and manages virtual machines while also offering these guests a virtual operating platform that's indistinguishable from actual hardware.  


public cloud
-------------
 is, a large cluster of machines run by another company. 

A private cloud
----------------
 takes the same concepts, but instead, it's entirely used by a single large corporation and generally physically hosted on its own premises.

  hybrid cloud, 
---------------
  isn't really a separate concept. It's just a term used to describe situations where companies might run things like their most sensitive proprietary technologies on a private cloud while entrusting their less sensitive servers to a public cloud. 


   X as a service.
   ---------------

   infrastructure as a service or IaaS. 
   -------------------------------------
   infrastructure as a service is that you shouldn't have to worry about building your own network or your own servers. You just pay someone else to provide you with that service. 


   PaaS
   -----
    Platform as a service is a subset of cloud computing where a platform is provided for customers to run their services. This basically means that an execution engine is provided for whatever software someone wants to run



*** Infrastructure as a service abstracts away the physical infrastructure you need
