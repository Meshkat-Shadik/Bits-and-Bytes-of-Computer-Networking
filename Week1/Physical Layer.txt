Moving ones and zeros:
---------------------
Bit:
---
A bit is the smallest representation of data that a computer can understand. It's a one or a zero.

Modulation:
-----------
Ones and zeros are sent across those network cables through a process called modulation. Modulation is a way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable.

Why Twisted Cables?
-------------------
twisted nature helps protect against electromagnetic interference and crosstalk from neighboring pairs

in all modern forms of networking, it's important to know that these cables allow for duplex communication.

Duplex : both direction synchronously
Simplex : One direction
Full Duplex : both at a time

Patch Panels:
-------------
A Patch panel is a device containing many net ports but it does no other work.
