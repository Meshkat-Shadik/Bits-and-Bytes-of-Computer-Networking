Ethernet :
----------
The protocol most widely used to send data across individual links is known as Ethernet. 
Ethernet, as a protocol, solved the problem collision between device communication by using a technique known as carrier sense multiple access with collision detection. (CSMA/CD).

CSMA/CD:
--------
CSMA/CD is used to determine when the communications channels are clear and when the device is free to transmit data.

MAC:
---
Media access control address.
a globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface
48 bit, 6 groupings

Octet:
------
any number that can be represented by 8 bits

total number of possible MAC address is 2^48
first 3 octets are Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)
last 3 octets are Vendor Assigned (NIC Cards, Interface)

UNI CAST:
---------
Just one receiving address

LSB : 0 => Ethernet frame is intended for only the destination address
LSB : 1 => Multicast frame
all F => Broadcast address
