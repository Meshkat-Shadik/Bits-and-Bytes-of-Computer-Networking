Cables:
-------
Cables are what connect different devices to each other allowing data to be transmitted over them

2 catagories :
 Copper, Fibers

The sending device communicates binary data across these copper wires by changing the voltage between two ranges

The most common forms of copper twisted pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables. 

Crosstalk:
----------
Crosstalk is when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire. So, the receiving end isn't able to understand the data causing a network error

fiber cables use pulses of light to represent the ones and zeros of the underlying data
