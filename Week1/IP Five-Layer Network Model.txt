The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model:

Layer No    Layer Name      Protocol            Protocol Data Unit      Addressing
--------    ----------      --------            ------------------      ----------
5           Application     HTTP,SMTP               Messaging           n/a
4           Transport       TCP/UDP                 Segment             port #'s
3           Network         IP                      Datagram/Packet     IP Address
2           Data Link       Ethernet/Wi-Fi          Frames              Mac Address
1           Physical        10Base T, 802.11        Bits                n/a


Physical:
---------
Cabling, connectors & sending signals

DataLink:
---------
is responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals, so network devices can communicate. (Same network)

Network(Internet layer):
------------------------
Different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers.

***Internet : Collection of networks connected together is inter networking (internet).

Transport:
---------
Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data.
TCP provides mechanisms to ensure that data is reliably delivered while UDP does not. 

Application:
------------
User interface.
